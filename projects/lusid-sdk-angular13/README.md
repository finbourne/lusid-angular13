# LUSID API Client for Angular 13

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

You can use the standard Angular CLI (ng) commands to enhance this project.

## Overview

This is used to generate the **__lusid-sdk-angular13__** npm package.

This uses **Open API Tools** [openapi-generator-cli](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) to auto-generate files from the specified LUSID OpenApi specification, available from 
[here](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger/index.html).

The generated files are not checked in but can be found in the `projects\lusid-sdk-angular13\src\lib\.generated` folder after running the generator.
